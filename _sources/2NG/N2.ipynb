Perhaps we can emphathize with the ancient geometers who were confused. Tons of Eudlidean geometry goes through just fine without any parallel axiom at all. Perpendicular lines behave nicely, and triangles work really well with the exception of their angle-sums. We even get half of the AIA theorem: congrunet alternate interior angles implies two lines are parallel.\n",
