    "Many theorems of traditional, high school geometry are true regardless of which parallel postulate is used. A *neutral geometry* is one in which no parallel postulate exists, and the theorems of a netural geometry are true for Euclidean and (some) non-Euclidean geomteries. We will explore neutral geometry until forced into a choice about how  parallel lines must work. Without a parallel postulate, the basic theorems of both Euclidean and hyperbolic geometry are true. This difficulty confused geometers for more than two thousand years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spherical geometry is a special case of elliptical geometry where the lines of the geometry are great circles of the sphere. In spherical geometry, triangles have angle sums greater than $180^{\\circ}$. Elliptical and spherical geometry develops along a separate path from Euclidean and hyperbolic geometries, and the axioms and theorems of neutral geometry do not typically apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "The axioms and theorems of netural geometry can be proven using the SMSG axioms 1 through 15. In the SMSG axiom list, Axiom 16 is the Euclidean parallel postulate. A neutral geometry assumes only the first 15 axioms of the SMSG set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes on Notation.** The SMSG axioms refer to the length or measure of line segments and the measure of angles. Thus, we will use the notation $\\overline{AB}$ to describe a line segment but use $AB$ to denote its length or measure. We refer to the angle formed by $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AC}$ as $\\angle BAC$ (with vertex $A$) and denote its measure as $m\\angle BAC$."

    "## Axiomatics of Neutral Geometry\n",
    "\n",
    "When undergraduate math majors encounter proofs for the first time, they often wonder why in the world anyone would need to prove that the number $\\sqrt 2$ exists. Mathematicians prove every single result starting from the axioms and defined terms. Undergraduate math majors often roll their eyes. What's the point? For many students, these exercises are tedious at best, confusing at worst.\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest problem for geometers is that geometric lines are not necessarily *complete*. We can have sequences of points on a line where the distances between successive terms get smaller and smaller, yet the limiting point is nowhere to be found. The completeness property means that any two lines that \"cross\" each other actually intersect.\n",

    "\n",
    "The SMSG Axioms form a bridge to the most interesting and accessible results of Euclidean geometry. The tedium of proving completeness of all lines is avoided, and \"real\" geometry takes place almost immediately. For neutral geometry, we will assume only the first 15 of the SMSG axioms are true. Axiom 16 is the parallel postulate. \n",
    "\n",
    "The undefined terms for the SMSG axioms are often said to be *points*, *lines* and *plane*. The hidden gold of the SMSG axioms is that they provide tools from three categories of mathematics.\n",
    "* Sets\n",
    "* Logic\n",
    "* Algebraic properties of real numbers\n",

    "\n",
    "The three sets of tools are a huge and immediate aid. When the notions of *sets* like containment and equality all make sense, we can immediately use and understand statements like \"$\\triangle ABC$ contains the point D\" or \"point $Z$ lies on line $\\overleftrightarrow{AB}$.\" We also assume that basic set operations like intersections, unions and set subtraction work properly. The SMSG axioms use the defined term  *space* which is the universal set: the set of all points, lines and planes in the geometry. \n",
    "\n",
    "We may use the formal laws of *logic*. For example, to prove a statement false, we need only one counterexample. Proving the contrapositive is equivalent to proving the original statement. Just because a statement is true does not imply its converse is true. We do not prove these logical constructs work, we simply use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *algebraic properties of real numbers* provide a huge ski jump that sends us flying past many tedious and technical proofs. We can solve equations, distribute and cancel. We have additive and multiplicative identies and inverses. When we multiply through an inequality by a negative real number, the inequality \"flips.\" All of these ideas and much more form the algebraic properties of real numbers. As you will see in the Ruler Postulate, every line in our geometry will have all the properties of the real number line. The idea of mathematical *completeness* comes along, too. Any real number we can imagine exists and can be placed precisely in relation to any other quantity. SMSG axioms like the Distance Postulate and Angle Measurement Postulate leverage the properties of real numbers so that we can construct things like midpoints of segments and bisectors of angles. Terms *angle measure*, *area* and *volume* make sense after being defined as corresponding to real numbers.\n",

    "The axioms for Neutral Geometry are the first 15 SMSG Axioms.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Line Uniqueness**. Given any two different points, there is exactly one line which contains both of them.\n",

    "8. **Plane Intersection**. If two different planes intersect, then their intersection is a line.\n",
    "9. **Plane Separation Postulate**. Given a line and a plane containing it, the points of the plane that do not lie on the line form two sets such that\n",
    "    1. each of the sets is convex, and\n",

    "14. **Supplementary Postulate**. If two angles form a linear pair, then they are supplementary.\n",
    "15. **Side Angle Side Postulate**. Given a one-to-one correspondence between two triangles (or between a triangle and itself), if two sides and the included angle of the first triangle are congruent to the corresponding parts of the second triangle, the correspondence is a congruence."
