    "Use analytic geometric techniques to prove the following well-known Euclidean geometry theorems. Make sure to pick the origin and axes so that the arbitrary figure is located helpfully with respect to the axes and has a useful orientation. Then use Euclidean theorems and equations of lines to prove the needed result."
