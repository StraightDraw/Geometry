    "\n",
    "6. **Angle Sum Theorem**. The angle sum of a convex quadrilateral is $360^\\circ$. Moreover, the angle sum of an $n$-sided convex polygon is $(n-2)180^\\circ$.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ````{tip}\n",
    "    The angle-sum theorem is true without the word \"convex,\" but it is easier prove with this restriction.\n",
    "    ````\n",
    "\n",
    "7. If a transversal intersects three parallel lines in such a way as to make congruent segments between the paralllels, then every transversal interesecting these parallel lines will do likewise.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ````{tip}\n",
    "    Construct additional well-placed transversals, and use similar triangles.\n",
    "    ````\n",
    "8. If a transversal intersects $n$ parallel lines ($n>2$) in such a way as to make congruent segments between the paralllels, then every transversal interesecting these parallel lines will do likewise. \n",
    "    ````{tip}\n",
    "    Use induction.\n",
    "    ````\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Median Concurrence Theorem**. The three medians of a triangle are concurent at a point called the centroid. \n",
    "    ````{tip} \n",
    "    Consider $\\triangle DFG$ with median $\\overline{DM}$. Note $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{FG}$. Call the centroid point $C$. Then the measure of $\\overline{DC}$ is exactly twice the measure of $\\overline{CM}$. This is true - but must be proven. Theorems 5 and 6 along with this fact provide an outline for the proof.\n",
    "    ````\n",
    "10. Medians of a triangle intersect at a point that is two-thirds the distance from any vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ````{note} \n",
    "    The following theorems are direct consequences of the Euclidean parallel postulate and establish many common notions in Euclidean geometry.\n",
    "    ````\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Two lines parallel to another line are parallel to each other.\n",
    "12. If a line intersects one of two parallel llines, then it interesects the other.\n",
    "13. Each diagonal of a parallelogram partitions the parallelogram into a pair of congruent triangles.\n",
    "14. The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.\n",
    "15. If the diagonals of a quadrilateral bisect each other, the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.\n",
    "16. If a line segment has as its endpoints the midpoints of two sides of a triangle, then the segment is parallel to and one-half the length of the third side of the triangle. \n",
    "17. The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular.\n",
    "18. If the diagonals of a quadrilateral bisect each other and are perpendicular, then the quadrilateral is a rhombus.\n",
    "19. In a right triangle, the median from the right angle to the hypotenuse is one-half the length of the hypotenuse.\n",
    "20. In a right triangle, one of the angles measures $30^\\circ$ if and only if the side opposite this angle is one-half the length of the hypotenuse. \n",
    "    ````{note} This result along with the Pythagorean Theorem gives us the $1-2-\\sqrt3$ ratio of side lengths for $30-60-90$ right triangles. The Pythagorean Theorem will be proven later.\n",
    "    ````\n",
    "21. The midpoints of the sides of a quadrilateral are the vertices of a convex parallelogram."
