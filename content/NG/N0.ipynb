    "We will explore *neutral geometry* where no parallel postulate exists. Most triangle theorems go through just fine, but the big bump in the road is quadrilaterals, a bump that confused mathematicians for more than two thousand years. The animation below shows triangles and quadrilaterals in a hyperbolic geometry. The angles are Euclidean, but the distances are not. Curiously, hyperbolic geometry is also allowed (along with Eucliden geometry) if we do not include a parallel axiom.\n",

    "When undergraduate math majors encounter proofs for the first time, they often wonder why in the world anyone would need to prove that the number $\\sqrt 2$ exists. Mathematicians prove every single result starting from the axioms and defined terms. Undergraduate math majors often roll their eyes. What's the point of proving that the point where two lines intersect is actually on both lines? For many students, these exercises are tedious at best, confusing at worst.\n",

    "The biggest problem for geometers is that geometric lines are not necessarily *continuous* and *complete*. Continuous functions are familiar to calculus students.
