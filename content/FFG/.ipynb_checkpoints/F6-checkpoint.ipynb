    "The 19th century produced a revolution in formal logic and the study of axiomatics. One result was that it became clear that Euclid's system was both incomplete and, insofar as it went, failed to meet the modern standards of rigor. German mathematician [David Hilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert) attempted to rectify these issues and published a new system of axioms in his book *Grundlagen der Geometrie* in 1898.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hilbert's set of axioms was independent and complete. His formulation also split the axioms into differents sets: *incidence* axioms, *betweeness* axioms and *congruence* axioms. His idea is obvious: he knew the properties and theorems needed to make Euclidean Geometry work \"correctly,\" and he developed structures within each set of axioms to force those properties into the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another important set of independent and complete Euclidean axioms was provided by Birkhoff. Where Hilbert had more than a dozen axioms, Birkhoff's elegant approach had only four axioms. The final important set of Eculidean axioms we will work with is a dependent system but was designed for use in secondary mathematics textbooks (SMSG). More axioms are given than are needed, but students aren't stuck proving theorems like \"two lines on the same two points are the same line.\" The additional axioms move the starting point into interesting and important ideas for school mathematics.\n",

    "The study of Euclidean Geometry has to focus on the Fifth Postulate, Euclid's Parallel Postulate, which has been controversial since antiquity. Euclid himself appears to have worried about it. Greek geometers argued it wasn't an axiom, it was a theorem. The idea is simple: *If two lines are parallel, they never meet*."
