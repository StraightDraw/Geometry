    "Recall that Theorem 7, the Median Concurrence Theorem, established the *centroid* of the triangle. The centroid is the \"center of mass\" of a triangle. If the triangle and its interior were made of metal with perfectly constant mass, thickness and density, the centroid would be the balance point for that object. We have several triangle concurrence theorems and several notions of the center of a circle:\n",

For the *angle bisector concurrence*, for example, we would start with an arbitrary $\\triangle ABC$ and *construct* the angle bisectors of $\\angle A$ and $\\angle B$. If these two lines are not parallel (you can prove they are not), then they intersect. Label this intersection $P$ and prove that the angle bisector of $\\angle C$ passes through it.\n",

    "    We often instruct students to think intuitively about the distance from a point to a line as the \"minimum distance\" from $P$ to $l$. This idea is equivalent to the definition because any other line segment drawn from $P$ to $l$ would be the hypotenuse of a right triangle. The Triangle Inequality then implies the new segment has a length greater than the distance from $P$ to $l$.\n",
