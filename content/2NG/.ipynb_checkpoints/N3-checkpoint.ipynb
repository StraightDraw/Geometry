    "As quests go, they both failed. However, their heroic quests both produced a great deal of geometric insight. Their investigations pushed neutral geometry to the brink of success.\n",
    "\n",
    "Saccheri and Lambert both noticed what we found in the previous section: perpendicular lines and right angles behave quite well in a neutral geometry. They both created quadrilaterals with right angles to see if they could push through a proof that rectangles must exist even with no parallel condition specified. Lambert created a quadrilateral with three right angles and attempted to prove the fourth must be a right angle, too. Saccheri's idea was to use two congruent sides both of which were perpendicular to a third side. The Saccheri quadrilateral was first used centuries earlier by [Omar Khayyam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayyam), one of the earliest heroes to attempt the quest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Saccheri knew that triangles having an angle sum of exactly $180^\\circ$ forced the geometry to be Euclidean, so he assumed the opposite. He quickly proved that, if angle sums were greater than $180^\\circ$, lines would have finite length which would contradict Euclid's Second Postulate. Investigations into the assumption that triangles had angle sums less than $180^\\circ$ were much more fruitful and produced some of the earliest insights into hyperbolic geometry. Unfortunately, he also \"proved\" hyperbolic geometry was impossible, an ignominious ending to his brave quest.\n",
