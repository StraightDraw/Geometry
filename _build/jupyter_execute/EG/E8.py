# 3.8 Homework

Definitions
: A quadrilateral with exactly one pair of opposite sides parallel.  The parallel sides of a trapezoid are called the *bases*. The non-parallel sides of a trapezoid are called the *legs*. The *base angles* of a trapezoid refer to a pair of angles whose vertices are the endpoints of the same base segment.

Median of a Trapezoid
: The line segment joining the midpoints of the legs.

## Theorems

22. A quadrilateral is a square if and only if it is a rhombus with a right angle.
23. A quadrilateral is a square if and only if it is a rhombus with two adjacent sides perpendicular.
24. The area of a rhombus is one-half the product of its diagonals.
25. Create a conjecture about the diagonals of a square, and prove it.
26. Rays $\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\overrightarrow{AC}$ are tangent to a circle at $B$ and $C$. Chord $\overline{BD}$ is drawn from $B\parallel \overrightarrow{AC}$. Prove that $\triangle BCD$ is isosceles.
27. The point $A$ is in the interior of a circle with center $O$ and radius $r$. Prove that $CA\times AD=r^2-(OA)^2$ where $\overline{DC}$ is any chord through $A$.
28. The diagonals of trapezoid $ABCD$ with bases $\overline{AB}\parallel\overline{CD}$ meet at the point $P$. The legs of the trapezoid are tangent to the circle through points $D,P,C$ at points $D$ and $C$. Prove:
    1. $\angle BAC\cong\angle ADB$.
    2. $\overline{AB}$ is tangent to the circle through points $D,P,A$.

29. An inscribed triangle one side of which is a diameter of the circle must be a right triangle.
30. Angles inscribed in the same or congruent arcs are congruent.
31. $\triangle ABC$ is inscribed in a circle with $\overleftrightarrow{RS}$ tangent to the circle at point $C$ with $R*C*S$. Prove:
    1. $\angle RCA\cong\angle B$, and
    2. $\angle SCB\cong\angle A$.

32. **Law of Sines**. In any $\triangle ABC$, $$\frac{a}{\sin A}=\frac{b}{\sin B}=\frac{c}{\sin C}=2r$$ where r is the radius of the circumcircle of $\triangle ABC$. 

    ````{hint} 
    Prove $\frac{a}{\sin A}=2r$ using three cases.

33. All four sides of quadrilateral $ABCD$ are tangent to an inscribed circle. Prove that the sums of the lengths of opposite sides of $ABCD$ are equal, e.g.$$AB+CD=BC+DA$$
34. A common chord of two overlapping circles joins the points of intersection of the circles and is thus a chord for both. Prove that the three common chords of three mutually overlapping circles are concurrent. 

    ````{note}
    We don't neccessarily have three common chords in general, so the circles must intersect in ways that produce three common chords.
