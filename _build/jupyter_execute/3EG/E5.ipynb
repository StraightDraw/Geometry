    "## Theorems\n",
    "1. In the Euclidean plane, three distinct points uniquely determine a circle. (Requires both an existance proof and a uniqueness proof.)\n",
    "2. If $\\overline{AB}$ is a diameter and $\\overline{CD}$ is any other chord of the same circle (which is not a diameter), then $AB>CD$.\n",
    "3. If a diameter of a circle is perpendicular to a chord of the circle, then the diameter bisects the chord.\n",
    "4. The perpendicular bisector of a chord of a circle contains a diameter of the circle.\n",
    "5. If a line is tangent to a circle, it is perpendicular to the line joining the point of tangency to the center of the circle.\n",
    "6. **Arc Addition**. If $\\overset{\\Huge\\frown}{ABC}$ and $\\overset{\\Huge\\frown}{CDE}$ are arcs sharing only the same endpoint $C$, then $m\\overset{\\Huge\\frown}{ABC}+m\\overset{\\Huge\\frown}{CDE}=m\\overset{\\Huge\\frown}{ACE}$.\n",
    "7. **Inscribed Angle Theorem**. The measure of an angle inscribed in an arc is one-half the measure of its intercepted arc. \n",

    "    The measure of an arc is equal to the measure of the central angle corresponding to the arc.\n",
    "    ````\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Two-Chord Angle Theorem**. If two chords interesect in the interior of a circle to determine an angle, the measure of that angle is the average of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the angle and its vertical angles.\n",
