    "If a triangle has a right angle, several interesting relationships form. Now that we have similarity defined, we can use it for a second proof of the Pythaogrean Theorem. The area-based proof of the Pythagorean Theorem was shown earlier, but the similarity proof demonstrates the close relationship between the Pythagorean Theorem and the Geometric Mean Theorem."

    "    The above theorem has a stunning implication: the midpoints of **any quadrilateral** are the vertices of a parallelogram. While it doesn't exactly fit the theme of this section, we'll prove it here because it is a straightforward consequence of the theorem we just proved.\n",
