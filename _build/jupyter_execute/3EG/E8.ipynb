    ": A quadrilateral with exactly one pair of opposite sides parallel.  The parallel sides of a trapezoid are called the *bases*. The non-parallel sides of a trapezoid are called the *legs*. The *base angles* of a trapezoid refer to a pair of angles whose vertices are the endpoints of the same base segment.\n",
