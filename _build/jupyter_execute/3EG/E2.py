# 3.2 Parallel Lines

We know the medians of a triangle are concurrent at a point called the centroid, but proving it requires a result about sets of equally-spaced parallel lines. 

Median
: A line passing through a vertex and the midpoint of the opposite side.

````{admonition} A Theorem for the Toolbox
:class: tip
The Transversal Congruence theorem is used only once, but we need it to prove that the medians of a triangle are conurrent.
````

**Transversal Congruence Lemma**. If a transversal intersects three parallel lines in such a way as to make congruent segments between the paralllels, then every transversal interesecting these parallel lines will do likewise.

## Theorems
1. **Transversal Congruence Theorem**. [^1] If a transversal intersects $n$ parallel lines ($n>2$) in such a way as to make congruent segments between the parallels, then every transversal interesecting these parallel lines will do likewise.
2. **Median Concurrence Theorem**. The three medians of a triangle are concurent. The concurrency point, called the *centroid*, is two-thirds of the distant from any vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.

    ````{hint}
    Use the Transversal Segment Congruence Theorem to prove the Median Concurrence Theorem.
    ````

3. Two lines parallel to another line are parallel to each other.
4. If a line intersects one of two parallel lines, then it interesects the other.
5. Parallel lines are everywhere equidistant.

````{warning}
Parallel lines are everywhere equidistant **only** in Euclidean geometries. This visualization is often taught to school children as a definition of parallel, but in formal geometry, two lines being parallel simply means that they do not intersect.
