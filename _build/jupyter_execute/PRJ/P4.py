## Project Ideas

There is so much interesting geometry at the cut-the-knot, it's hard to list a Top Ten or anything like that. Click on a few of the links below to see what kinds of things are possible. Definitely spend some time kicking around cut-the-knot before you decide on your final project idea.

1. [Apollonian circles](https://www.cut-the-knot.org/Curriculum/Geometry/LocusCircle.shtml#ac) or just Apollonius in general
2. [An old Japanese theorem](https://www.cut-the-knot.org/proofs/jap.shtml) with circles inscribed in polygons.
3. Search for anything related to Archimedes
4. [Sangaku and Egyptian Triangles](https://www.cut-the-knot.org/pythagoras/RopeStretchersSangaku.shtml#tr)
5. Anything related to Ceva, for example, [Cevian triangles](https://www.cut-the-knot.org/Generalization/ceva.shtml#cevian)
6. [The Buttefly Theorem](https://www.cut-the-knot.org/pythagoras/Butterfly.shtml)
7. [Morley's mirale](https://www.cut-the-knot.org/triangle/Morley/)
