    "Archimedes is regarded as the foremost mathematician of antiquity as well as one of the finest scientists of antiquity. While the Greeks knew many thoerems were true and used them in constructions, Archimedes was the first to rigorously derive formulas for the area of a circle and the volume and surface area of a sphere. He used the method of exhaustion and a primitive idea of infinitesimals to calculate volumes of revoluation, a Calculus II topic in most modern universities. Archimedes' quadrature of the surface area of a sphere and quadrature of a segment of a parabola stand as the most rigorous, analytic achievements of all antiquity.\n",
