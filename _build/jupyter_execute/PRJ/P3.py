# Regular Polygons

Using only a compass and straightedge, what regular polygons can be constructed? Why can certain regular polygons not be constructed, at least not in finite steps? What properties of regular polygons make them constructable? What properties make them inconstructible?

## Animation

For a quick overview of how to produce compass and straightedge constructions of, say, a 17-gon, check out this brief video.

## Project Ideas

1. Anything involving compass and straightedge constructions of regular polygons including focusing on a specific figure.
2. Finding the golden ratio or other interesting values in the constructions of various regular polygons.
3. Other interesting constructions relying upon or related to regular polygons.
