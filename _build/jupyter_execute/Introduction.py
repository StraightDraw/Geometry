# ## Course Notes for College Geometry
# Developed by Robb Sinn for use in UNG's [MATH 3120](https://catalog.ung.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=12&coid=13311).

# For the last 25 centuries, students learned logic and proof while studying geometry. At its best, Geometry is an axiomatic playground where students prove each theorem from first principles.
# 
# ````{warning}
# Many geometry books leave key terms undefined, or use concepts not yet established in the early definitions.
# ````
# 
# College geometry books are either too advanced to be suitable for a first course in geometry, or they fail to use the <a href = https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Geometry/The_SMSG_Postulates_for_Euclidean_Geometry>School Mathematics Study Group (SMSG) Axioms</a> which our future mathematics teachers need. Textbooks using the <a href = https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Geometry/The_SMSG_Postulates_for_Euclidean_Geometry>SMSG Axioms</a> are rarely rigourous enough that their definitions avoid vagueness and circularity mistakes. Often, "intuition" is preferred over rigor. The challenge of these notes is to begin with the <a href = https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Geometry/The_SMSG_Postulates_for_Euclidean_Geometry>SMSG Axioms</a> and build out the entire base of Euclidean Geometry.

# ````{tip}
# The puzzles of Geometry intrigued humanity for more than two thousand years.
# ````
# 
# Romance can pair with rigor if we search out the ancient mysteries. Why was Euclid's Fith Postulate controversial? Why did the controversy last more than twenty centuries? Who solved it?

# Greeks loved quadrature, the act of using a compass and straigtedge to create a square with the same area as given figure. Certain quadratures are impossible, like the classic "squaring the circle," yet it was centuries before anyone proved it to be impossible. 
# 
# To delve into these mysteries and others, we begin with *neutral geometry* and establish every possible theorem that can be proven with no parallel postulate at all. After Euclidean geometry is fully developed, we move on to Analytic Geometry and Trigonometry.
