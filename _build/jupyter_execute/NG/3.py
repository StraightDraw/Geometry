# # 2.3 Quadrilaterals

# ## The Saccheri-Legendre Theorem
# 
# 1. The sum of the measures of any two angles of a triangle is less than $180^\circ$.
# 2. For any $\triangle ABC$ there exists $\triangle A'B'C'$ having the same angle sum as $\triangle ABC$ but where $m\angle A'\leq\frac{1}{2}m\angle A$.
# 
#     ````{hint}
#     Use both of the previous two theorems to help you prove the Saccheri-Legendre Theorem.
#     ````
# 
# 3. **Saccheri-Legendre Theorem**. The angle sum of any triangle is less than or equal to $180^\circ$. 
# 
# 
# 4. The angle sum of any convex quadrilateral is less than or equal to $360^\circ$.
# 
# 5. **Unique Perpendicular**. Given a line $l$ and any point $P$ not on $l$, there exists a unique line $m$ such that $P\in m$ and $m\perp l$.

# ## Rectangles
# Offering the standard definitions of polygons and quadrilaterals is getting a bit ahead of ourselves since figures like parallelograms and rectangles don't exist without a parallel postulate. As soon as we have Playfair's parallel postulate, however, they make sense. Still, we need some structure to continue our investigation.
# 
# Polygon
# : A simple, closed curve comprised entirely of line segments.
# 
# Quadrilateral
# : A polygon containing exactly four line segments.
# 
# Parallelogram:
# : A convex quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel sides.
# 
# Rectangle
# : A rectangle is a parallelogram with a right angle.
# 
# ### Searching for Rectangles
# Rectangles don't exist in a neutral geometry. In fact, the existence of a rectangle is equivalent to the Euclidean parallel postulate. Two pioneers tried to use the idea of a rectangle to prove Euclid's Fifth Postulate: Saccheri and Lambert.
# 
# Saccheri Quadrilateral
# : A quadrilateral with two congruent sides, called *legs*, which are both perpendicular to a third side, called the *base*.
# 
# Lambert Quadrilateral
# : A quadrilateral with at least three right angles.
# 
# Summit
# : The line segment opposite the base of a Saccheri quadrilateral.
# 
# Summit Angles
# : The angles in a Saccheri quadrilateral that are adjacent to the summit.
# 
# Both Saccheri and Lambert formulated their quadrilaterals as an attempt to prove the Euclidean Parallel Postulate was a theorem. Of course, it's not, and they failed. However, their investigations led to deepened understanding of the implications of a parallel postulate and the creation of non-Euclidean geometries.
# 
# ## Theorems
# 
# 1. The diagonals of a Saccheri quadrilateral are congruent.
# 2. The summit angles of a Saccheri quadrilateral are congruent.
# 3. The summit angles of a Saccheri quadrilateral are not obtuse and thus are either right or acute.
# 4. The line joining the midpoints of the summit and base of a Saccheri quadrilateral are perpendicular to both.
# 5. The summit and base of a Saccheri quadrilateral are parallel.
# 6. In any Saccheri quadrilateral, the length of the summit is greater than or equal the length of the base. 
# 7. The fourth angle of a Lambert quadrilateral is not obtuse, and is therefore either right or acute.
# 8. The measure of the side included between two right angles of a Lambert quadrilateral is less than or equal to the measure of the side opposite it.
