    "2. Consider two circles $p$ and $q$ with centers $P$ and $Q$ respectively. If $p$ and $q$ intersect in exactly two points, say, $R$ and $S$, then quadrilateral $PRQS$ is a kite. If $p\\cong q$, $PQRS$ is a rhombus. If $p\\in Q$ and $q\\in P$, $\\triangle{PRQ}$ is equilateral, as is $\\triangle{PSQ}$."
