# # Axiomatics

# There are four sets of axioms that will produce Euclidean geometry.
# 
# * Euclid's *Elements*
# * Hilbert
# * Birkhoff
# * School Mathematics Study Group (SMSG)
# 
# *Elements* was the geometry text of choice for two millenia. However, the postulates are stated awkwardly, and huge assumptions are hidden everywhere.
# 
# Hilbert's work in the late 1800's finally created an independent set of axioms that produced all of Euclidean geometry. His grouping of axioms established the core concepts for Eudlidean geometry: **incidence** axioms (how objects connect to each other), **betweeness** axioms and **congruence** axioms.

# Birkhoff also created an independent set of only four axioms which do produce all of Euclidean geometry.
# 
# The SMSG axioms are typically used for geometry in K-12 classrooms. They are not independent, but the move the starting point to interesting theorems.
