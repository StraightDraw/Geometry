# 4. Analytic Geometry

Analytic geometry is the combination of basic algebra on a coordinate system with geometric definitions and constructions. The coordinate system used almost exclusively, especially in K12 schools, is the Cartesion coordinate plane.

````{note}
We can create a coordinate system using any two distinct points.

## Constructing the Cartesian Coordinate Plane

As a consequence of the plane uniqueness axiom (SMSG Ax. 7), we know that any two distinct, intersecting lines uniquely determine a plane. We wish to prove that any two distinct points uniquely determine a coordinate system.

````{admonition} Proof
:class: note
Let two points $P$ and $Q$ be arbitrary. Let $P$ be called the origin, and $PQ=1$ (Distance Postulate). By Axiom 1 (Line Uniqueness) call $\overleftrightarrow{PQ}$ the $x$-axis. Utilize Axiom 3 (Ruler Postulate) to mark off units on $x$-axis. Construct the unique perpendicular to $x$-axis through the origin $P$ (Thm 40). Call it the $y$-axis and mark off units (Ax 3).
