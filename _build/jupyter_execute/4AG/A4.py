# A.4 Conic Sections

We can derive basic formulas for the conic sections using simplifications, then generate more robust formulas later once we have worked the details of transformations.

Circle
: The set of all points equidistant from a point called the *center*.

Radius
: The common distance from a point on a circle to its center.

Parabola
: A set of points which are equidistant from a *focal point* $F$ and a line $l$ called the *directrix*.

Hyperbola
: A set of points where the absolute difference of the distances from two points (called the *foci*) is constant.


## Theorems

1. The equation of a circle centered at the origin with radius $r$ is given by 

    $$x^2+y^2=r^2$$

2. The equation of a circle centered at the point $(h,k)$ with radius $r$ is given by 

    $$(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=r^2$$

3. For a given parabola, drop a perpendicular from the focal point $F$ to the closest point on the directrix $P$. Prove the midpoint of $FP$ is on the parabola.

4. Suppose we have a parabola the direterix of which is the $x$-axis with focal point $F=(0,2)$. Prove that the set of all points $P=(x,y)$ on the parabola is equivalent to 

    $$y - 1 = \frac{1}{4}x^2$$
    
5. Suppose we have a parabola the direterix of which is the $x$-axis with focal point $F=(0,k)$. Prove that the set of all points $P=(x,y)$ on the parabola is equivalent to 

    $$y - k = \frac{1}{4k}x^2$$
