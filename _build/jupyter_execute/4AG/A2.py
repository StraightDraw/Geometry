# A.2 Proofs in Analytic Geometry

Use analytic geometric techniques to prove the following well-known Euclidean geometry theorems. Make sure to pick the origin and axes so that the arbitrary figure is located helpfully with respect to the axes and has a useful orientation. Then use Euclidean theorems and equations of lines to prove the needed result.

## Theorems
1. A quadrilateral ABCD is a parallelogram if and only if one pair of opposite sides are congruent.
    ````{hint}
    Most analytic geometry proofs are made easier if we remember that we choose the coordinate system to make our life easier. For the above proof, place the line segment $\overline{AB}$ on the $x$-axis such that $B=(0,0)$ and $A=(a,0)$. Locate $C$ and $D$ in the first quadrant.

2. The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.

3. The set of all rectangles with area equal to $1$ which have a vertex at the origin satisfy the relationship $y=\frac{1}{x}$.
