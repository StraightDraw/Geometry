# ## 1.4 Young's Geometry

# Changing a single axiom can generate a very different geometry. Young's Geometry is identical to Fano's Geometry except that Axiom 5 is different. Let's investigate what happens using the same undefined and defined terms and four of the same axioms:
# 
#     i.   There exists at least one line.
#     ii.  There are exactly three points on each line.
#     iii. Not all points are on the same line.
#     iv.  There is exactly one line on any two distinct points.
#     v.   For each line $l$ and each point $P$ not on $l$, there exists exactly one line on $P$ that does not contain any points on $l$.

# **Theorems.**
# 
# 1. In Young's Geometry, there exist at least four points.
# 2. Laurel's Lemma. In Young's Geometry, for each point $P$ there exists least one line $l$ that does not contain it.
# 3. In Young's Geometry, every point is on exactly four lines.
# 4. In Young's Geometry, if lines $l$ and $m$ intersect at a point $P$, and if line $l$ is parallel to line $n$, then lines $m$ and $n$ share a common point $Q$.
# 5. In Young's Geometry, two lines parallel to a third line are parallel to each other.
# 6. In Young's Geometry, every line has exactly two distinct lines that are parallel to it. (Hint: the previous two theorems serve as lemmas to help us prove this theorem.)
# 7. Young's Geometry contains exactly twelve lines. (Hint: Prove first that *at least* 12 lines exist. Next, that *no more than* 12 lines exist.)
# 8. Young's Geometry contains exactly nine points. (Same hint as above.)
