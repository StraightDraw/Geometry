# ## 1.3 Fano's Geometry

# Our approach will be very similar to the Four and Five Point Geometries using the same undefined terms. Here are the axioms for Fano's Geometry:
# 
#     i.   There exists at least one line.
#     ii.  There are exactly three points on each line.
#     iii. Not all points are on the same line.
#     iv.  There is exactly one line on any two distinct points.
#     v.   There is at least one point on any two distinct lines. 
# 
# We will also use the same defined terms as before: intersect, parallel and concurrent.

# **Theorems.**
# 
# 1. In Fano's Geometry, there exist at least four points.
# 2. Lindsey's Lemma. For every point $P$ in Fano's Geometry, there exists a line that does not contain it.
# 3. Fano's Geometry contains *at least* seven points.
# 4. Fano's Geometry contains *no more than* seven points.
# 
#     Note that Theorems 10 and 11 are actually two lemmas needed to prove that Fano's Geometry contains *exactly* seven points.
# 
# 5. Fano's Geometry contains \textbf{exactly} seven points.
# 6. Fano's Geometry contains \textbf{exactly} seven lines.
# 7. In Fano's Geometry, each line is on exactly three points.
# 8. In Fano's Geometry, the set of all lines on a single point contains all the points in the geometry. 
# 9. In Fano's Geometry, for every pair of points, there exist exactly two lines containing neither point.
# 10. In Fano's Geometry, each point is on exactly three lines.
