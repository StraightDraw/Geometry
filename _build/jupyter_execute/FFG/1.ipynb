    "Finite geometries are the most primitive axiomatic systems with a finite set of points and lines. The geometric ideas we meet studying finite geometry are robust and apply to more sophisticated geometries. The Incidence Axioms (see below) govern the relationship between points and lines and provide the building blocks necessary for ideas like *intersect* and *parallel*. \n",
