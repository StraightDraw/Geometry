    "[Young's Geometry](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/YoungsGeometry.html) is identical to [Fano's Geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fano_plane) except for Axiom 5. Young's geometry appears to be named for American mathematician [John Wesley Young](https://www.maa.org/about-maa/governance/maa-presidents/john-wesley-young-1929-1930-maa-president) who, along with [Oswald Veblen](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Veblen/), published a seminal treatise on projective geometry just before World War I. There is confusion at times between the 20th century American mathematician and several British matheticians with the same surname. Young spent the majority of his career at Dartmouth University and was president of the American Mathematical Society from 1929 - 1930.\n",
