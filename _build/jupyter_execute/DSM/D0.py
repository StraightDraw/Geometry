# # Dollar Sign Math for Geometry

# Mathematicians have been using LaTeX for decades. Now that the wider tech and scientific communities are working more often in markdown languages and creating their own equations, they use LaTeX and often call it Dollar Sign Math. Fortunately for math geeks, the wider adoption from the scientifi community has led to software like GeoGebra and D2L including a DSM equation editor as an option.

# ## DSM Code for Common Relations
# 
# The relations on the keyboard work fine: equality and strict inequalities. For example, given real numbers $x,y$, then either $x < y$, $x > y$ or $x = y$. Here are three common relations we often use.
# 
# ````{panels}
# :column: col-4
# Greater than or equal to

# $\geq$

# ## DSM Code for Sets
# 
# Modern geometry uses set theory as part of the fundamental logic of the system. Lines are sets of points, etc.
