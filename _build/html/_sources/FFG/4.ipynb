    "[Young's Geometry](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/YoungsGeometry.html) is identical to [Fano's Geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fano_plane) except for Axiom 5. The geometry appears to be named for American mathematician [John Wesley Young](https://www.maa.org/about-maa/governance/maa-presidents/john-wesley-young-1929-1930-maa-president) who, along with [Oswald Veblen](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Veblen/), published a seminal treatise on projective geometry just before World War I. Young spent the majority of his career at Dartmouth University and was president of the American Mathematical Society from 1929 - 1930.\n",
