    "The system begins with undefined terms *point*, *line* and *plane* and the fundamental **incidence relation**. We need two more relations: the *betweenness relation* denoted by $*$, and the *congruence relation* denoted by $\\cong$. All three relations are undefined and are given meaning within the corresponding set axioms. A quick note about incidence: although the relation $P\\in l$ should, strictly speaking, be read: \"$P$ and $l$ are incident,\" we shall use \"$l$ contains $P$,\" \"$P$ lies on $l$\" or any obviously logical equivalent.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Incidence Axioms\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For every pair of distinct points $A$ and $B$ there is a unique line $l$ containing $A$ and $B$.\n",
    "2. Every line contains at least two points.\n",
    "3. There are at least three points that do not lie on the same line.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Betweenness Axioms\n",
    "The next group of axioms deals with the relation \"$B$ lies between $A$ and $C$.\"  We will use the notation $A*B*C$ for \"$B$ lies between $A$ and $C$.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If $A*B*C$, then $A$, $B$ and $C$ are distinct points on a line, and $C*B*A$ also holds.\n",
    "2. Given two distinct points $A$ and $B$, there exists a point $C$ such that $A*B*C$.\n",
    "3. If $A$, $B$ and $C$ are distinct points on a line, then one and only one of the relations $A*B*C$, $B*C*A$ and $C*A*B$ is satisfied.\n",
    "4. Let $A$, $B$ and $C$ be points not on the same line and let $l$ be a line which contains none of them. If $D\\in l$ and $A*D*B$, there exists an $E$ on $l$ such that $B*E*C$, or an $F$ on $l$ such that $A*F*C$, but not both.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we think of $A$, $B$ and $C$ as the vertices of a triangle, another formulation of B4 is this: If a line $l$ goes through a side of a triangle but none of its vertices, then it also goes through exactly one of the other sides. This formulation is also called **Paschâ€™s Axiom**. Note that this is not true in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ where $n\\geq3$. Hence, I.3 and B.4 together define the geometry as \"2-dimensional.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Congruence Axioms\n",
    "We have two sets of three congruence axioms, the first for congruent line segments, the second for angle congrunce.\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Given a segment $AB$ and a ray $r$ from $C$, there is a uniquely determined point $D$ on $r$ such that $CD\\cong AB$.\n",
    "2. $\\cong$ is an equivalence relation on the set of segments.\n",
    "3. If $A*B*C$ and $A'*B'*C'$ and both $AB\\cong A'B'$ and $BC\\cong B'C'$, then also $AC\\cong A'C'$.\n",
    "4. Given a ray $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ and an angle $\\angle B'A'C'$, there are angles $\\angle BAE$ and $\\angle BAF$ on opposite sides of $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ such that $\\angle BAE \\cong \\angle BAF \\cong \\angle B'A'C'$.\n",
    "5. $\\cong$ is an equivalence relation on the set of angles.\n",
    "6. Given triangles $\\triangle ABC$ and $\\triangle A'B'C'$. If $AB \\cong A'B'$, $AC\\cong A'C'$ and $\\angle BAC\\cong \\angle B'A'C'$, then the two triangles are congruent: $BC\\cong B'C'$, $\\angle ABC \\cong \\angle A'B'C'$ and $\\angle BCA \\cong \\angle B'C'A'$.\n"
